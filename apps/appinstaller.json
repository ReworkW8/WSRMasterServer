    "description": "Bring the modern "Double-Click to Install" experience to Windows 8. In the original Windows 8 environment, installing .appx and .appxbundle files often required complex PowerShell commands or developer licenses. App Installer for Windows 8 is a lightweight, open-source utility designed to bridge this gap, providing a user-friendly interface for sideloading applications just like the modern "App Installer" found in Windows 10 and 11.",
